# XP Core Values

In this book-table project, our team of four found **Communication** and **Respect** to be vital for our success.

## Communication

Open and honest communication was one of the most important aspects of XP values we followed. It included:

- **Full Engagement in Meetings**: Participation in meetings was key as we stayed aligned on our goals and progress.  
- **Productive Discussions**: Our meeting discussions were very lively, and we shared our opinions, which led to healthy progress.  
- **Free Flow of Information**: We were spot on in identifying potential issues and discussing various ways to build a feature, fostering shared understanding.

## Respect

Mutual respect was the foundation of our teamwork:

- **Valuing Contributions**: We appreciated the job done by each team member, irrespective of how small or big it was. This created a positive and motivating atmosphere.  
- **Constructive Disagreements**: When our views didn't match, we concentrated on the pros and cons of the suggestions themselves. This helped us discuss things usefully and find the strongest solutions together.  
- **Team Support**: As a small team, we consistently supported each other, offering help with challenges and ensuring no one felt overwhelmed or isolated. This built a strong sense of camaraderie and trust.
